Title: Research Paper Implementation: Leveraging Guides for Certified Reasoning in Language Models

Introduction:
This research paper focuses on implementing a framework that allows language models (LMs) to rely on trusted formal deductions during generation by utilizing external tools called guides. The guides enable a declarative interaction between the tool and the model, facilitating logical reasoning and producing reliable natural language rationales. The authors introduce the LOGICGUIDE as a guide tool for LMs to perform externally certified reasoning using the Peano theorem-proving environment.

Architecture:
1. Guide Functions: The guide function, g, defines a set of valid generations given previous choices. It takes a sequence of previously generated strings and returns a regular set of allowed next generations.
2. Guide Tools as Completion Engines: The guide tool is implemented as a completion engine using the Constrained Semantic Decoding (CSD) algorithm. The completion engine, c, dynamically computes a set of valid continuations, constraining the LM's output between special delimiters.
3. The LOGICGUIDE: LOGICGUIDE is a guide tool that leverages the Peano theorem-proving environment. It allows LMs to perform externally certified reasoning by formalizing assumptions, setting proof goals, and making sound inference steps.

Algorithmic Pseudocode:
1. Guide Functions:
```
function guideFunction(generatedSequence):
    return set of valid next generations based on generatedSequence
```

2. Guide Tools as Completion Engines:
```
function completionEngine(inputString):
    if inputString ends with t1:
        Sp = extract blocks of text between t1 and t2 in inputString
        return regular expression matching strings in guideFunction(Sp) ending with t2
    else:
        return regular expression matching any string not containing t1 and ending in t1
```

Mathematical Algorithmic Proof:
The implementation of guide functions and completion engines ensures that the LM generates sequences within the constraints defined by the guides. The CSD algorithm guarantees a valid sample by construction, leveraging the completion engine to determine valid continuations at each step of generation.

Other Important Information:
The research paper discusses the compatibility of the framework with different LM architectures, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and LLaMA. It also highlights the effectiveness of the LOGICGUIDE in improving reasoning accuracy and reducing content effects in LMs. The paper mentions the use of few-shot prompting and the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) approach for further improvements in reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion:
Implementing the proposed framework enables LMs to perform certified reasoning by incorporating external tools and logical guides. The LOGICGUIDE, based on the Peano theorem-proving environment, allows LMs to generate reliable natural language rationales backed by formal logical inferences. This approach expands the computational power of LMs and provides a promising avenue for combining formal reasoning with the flexibility of language models.

From the provided research paper, it's evident that we are implementing a guide tool named LOGICGUIDE that leverages Constrained Semantic Decoding (CSD) and a guide function to perform certified logical reasoning.

#### Architecture

1. **Guide Functions**: This function defines a set of valid generations given previous choices. Formally, it takes a sequence of previously generated strings and returns a regular set of allowed next generations. When the guide is invoked at a prefix, we will sample a continuation from the language model that belongs to the set allowed by the guide.

2. **Completion Engines and Constrained Semantic Decoding (CSD)**: A completion engine is a function that takes a string in the vocabulary and returns a regular expression over that vocabulary. The completion engine can dynamically compute a set of valid continuations. CSD is employed to constrain the output of the underlying model at inference time by leveraging a user-defined completion engine. The completion engine implements the guide tool for a guide function.

3. **LOGICGUIDE**: This is a guide tool that performs externally certified reasoning. It leverages the theorem-proving language, Peano, to provide a finite action space for valid inferences that can be made in a single step.

#### Algorithmic Pseudocode

```
Initialize guide function g, language model PLM, completion engine c, guide tool LOGICGUIDE, and special strings t1, t2

function g(S*):
    return P(S)

while decoding:
    if prefix s0:
        s <- Sample a continuation from PLM(s|s0) that belongs to the set allowed by g
    end if

    if s ends in t1:
        Sp <- Collect all blocks of text between occurrences of t1 and t2 in s
        c(s) <- Return a regular expression matching the strings in g(Sp)
    else:
        c(s) <- Return a regular expression matching any string not containing t1 and ending in t1
    end if

    if s invokes the guide tool:
        Perform logical inferences using LOGICGUIDE
    end if
end while
```

#### Updated LogicGuide class

Since I don't have the initial LogicGuide class, I'll write an implementation based on the paper's description. Here's a high-level implementation:

```python
class LogicGuide:
    def __init__(self, language_model, guide_function):
        self.language_model = language_model
        self.guide_function = guide_function
        self.t1 = "[["  # Guide trigger
        self.t2 = "]]"  # End of trusted generation

    def guide(self, S):
        return self.guide_function(S)

    def completion_engine(self, s):
        if s.endswith(self.t1):
            Sp = self.get_blocks(s)
            return self.guide(Sp)
        else:
            return f"[^{self.t1}]*{self.t1}"

    def get_blocks(self, s):
        blocks = []
        split_s = s.split(self.t1)
        for block in split_s[1:]:
            if self.t2 in block:
                blocks.append(block.split(self.t2)[0])
        return blocks

    def invoke_guide_tool(self, s):
        if self.t1 in s:
            s = self.completion_engine(s)
            return self.language_model.sample(s)
        else:
            return s
```
Note: The actual implementation might need to be more sophisticated to handle the Constrained Semantic Decoding (CSD) as well as interactions with the underlying language model and the theorem-proving environment like Peano. The completion engine and guide functions also might need to be more complex depending on the context in which they are used.


The guide function in the context of this research paper is a concept introduced to improve language models' capabilities in logical reasoning or other complex tasks. 

The guide function, as outlined in the paper, is a function `g: S* → P(S)` that takes a sequence of previously generated strings and returns a set of valid next generations. Here, S represents the set of strings in the guide's alphabet and S* denotes the set of finite sequences of such strings. The purpose of the guide function is to limit the language model's generations to a set of valid and logically consistent outputs, improving the overall quality of the model's output.

In principle, the guide function should be capable of recognizing a point in the conversation where guidance is needed (for instance, in logical reasoning or factual inaccuracy) and intervene to guide the language model's generation towards a more desirable or accurate output. This is often done by modifying the probability distribution over the model's vocabulary during generation.

The reason I haven't implemented the guide function in the class is because the guide function can vary greatly depending on the specific task or context. For instance, a guide function for logical reasoning might look significantly different from a guide function for factual accuracy. Therefore, it's left for the user to implement a guide function that fits their specific needs.

The provided `LogicGuide` class allows you to inject your own guide function as a parameter, which is then used in the `generate` method to guide the model's generations. You can create different guide functions for different tasks and use them with the `LogicGuide` class. For instance, you might create a guide function that checks if the model's output is logically consistent, or another guide function that checks if the model's output is factually accurate. The guide function can then use various techniques, such as rule-based systems, statistical methods, or even other machine learning models, to modify the probability distribution over the model's vocabulary during generation.

The guide function should typically be designed according to the specific needs of the task at hand. However, I can provide a basic example of a guide function for the task of generating next tokens which are only digits. This could serve as a template to implement more complex guide functions.

This guide function will use regular expressions to constrain the output of the language model such that it can only generate tokens which are digits.

```python
import re

class DigitGuide:
    def __init__(self):
        self.regex = re.compile(r"\d+")

    def __call__(self, history):
        if self.regex.match(history):
            return self.regex
        else:
            return None
```

This guide function will be used to guide the generation of the language model by constraining the output to be only digits. The guide function takes the history of generated tokens as input and returns a regular expression if the history matches the regular expression, else it returns `None`.

This is a simplistic guide function and it might not be sufficient for complex tasks, but it provides a starting point for implementing more sophisticated guide functions.

For a guide function that works for any task, it's a bit more complex because tasks can greatly vary in their requirements. A simple "universal" guide function could just return the history as it is:

```python
class UniversalGuide:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __call__(self, history):
        return history
```

But note that this guide function will not constrain the model's generation in any way. In practice, the guide function should be designed according to the specific needs of the task. This could involve using machine learning models, rule-based systems, statistical methods, or any combination of these to guide the generation of the language model.

Remember that these guide functions are just templates. For your specific task, you will need to define a guide function that suits your needs.


The guide function as described in the paper is a function that acts as an interface between the language model and an external tool, ensuring that the model's output adheres to specific constraints such as logical consistency or factual accuracy.

Given that the concept of a guide function is rather abstract and would involve deep integration with the inner workings of a language model, it's challenging to implement it directly in Python code without being overly simplistic or contrived.

For the purpose of this conversation, I'll provide a basic, high-level simulation of how such a guide function could work. Keep in mind, this won't be a fully-functional code but a pseudo-implementation to give a rough idea of the concept:

```python
class GuideFunction:
    def __init__(self, tool):
        self.tool = tool

    def __call__(self, model_output):
        return self.tool.check(model_output)

class LogicTool:
    def check(self, text):
        # Pseudo-code: Use a complex logic-checking system to verify the logical consistency of text
        # For example, you could implement some sort of semantic analysis and logical inference system
        # For simplicity, we'll return true
        return True

class FactTool:
    def check(self, text):
        # Pseudo-code: Use a complex fact-checking system to verify the factual accuracy of text
        # For example, you could implement a system that cross-references the text with a reliable database of facts
        # For simplicity, we'll return true
        return True

logic_guide = GuideFunction(LogicTool())
fact_guide = GuideFunction(FactTool())
```

In the above pseudo-code, the `GuideFunction` takes an instance of a tool as an argument, and this tool is used to check the model's output whenever the guide function is called.

The `LogicTool` and `FactTool` are placeholders for more complex systems that check for logical consistency and factual accuracy, respectively. In a real-world scenario, these would need to be sophisticated systems capable of performing semantic analysis, logical inference, and fact checking.

The actual implementation of these systems is beyond the scope of this conversation, as it would involve significant complexity and require a comprehensive understanding of natural language processing, formal logic, and fact-checking methodologies.

Please remember that the code snippets are highly abstract and can't be directly used, rather they serve the purpose of visualizing the concept in code. For a practical implementation, we would require an interface where language models can interact with guide functions, which in turn would need to handle complex tasks of logical consistency or fact-checking as per the application requirements.


In the document you provided, there are several aspects that could potentially be represented as Python code:

1. The Transformer model for modeling the ECHO task: This task is based on reproducing the same string as output after receiving it as input.
2. The Guide function for the PARITY task: This is a mechanism that supports the Transformer model to classify binary strings based on the parity (even number of 1's) of the string.
3. The implementation of several guide ideas: These are the Logic Guide, Memory Guide, Quote Guide, Algebra Guide.
4. The DeontiQA problem generation: This involves generating a logic problem based on some provided theory and then translating it into a natural language format.

To give an example of how one might start to implement the ECHO Transformer and the PARITY guide function in Python, I will outline a possible pseudocode/plan and then a Python code example. Note that this will be a simplification of the models described, and will not cover all aspects. Also, this will be a basic implementation for illustrative purposes and not a production-ready code.

#### Pseudocode for ECHO Transformer:

1. Initialize the Transformer with a single self-attention layer and a final linear output layer.
2. Define the input and positional embeddings for the transformer.
3. Define the weight matrices Q, K, and V for the self-attention layer.
4. For every input symbol in the sequence:
   - Calculate the hidden vector for each input symbol.
   - Use the self-attention mechanism to construct the output.
5. Return the sequence of output symbols.

#### Pseudocode for PARITY guide function:

1. Define the guide function that checks if the number of 1's in the binary string is even.
2. For every binary string:
   - Check if the binary string belongs to the PARITY language.
   - Assign the corresponding class label.
3. Return the class labels.

Please note that this pseudocode may not represent the complete functionality as described in the paper due to its complexity. Also, this is a very high-level view, real-world code implementation would require lower-level details including defining loss functions, optimization methods, handling of gradients, and more.

Let's now consider a simplified Python implementation for the Transformer model that could model the ECHO task:

```python
import torch
from torch.nn import Transformer

class EchoTransformer():
    def __init__(self, ntokens, ninp):
        self.model = Transformer(ninp, nhead, nhid, nlayers, dropout).to(device)
        self.encoder = lambda x: x # Simplified encoder for illustration

    def forward(self, src):
        src = self.encoder(src) # Input embedding
        output = self.model(src) # Self-attention mechanism
        return output
```
And here is a simple example of a guide function for the PARITY task:

```python
def parity_guide(binary_string):
    count = binary_string.count('1')
    if count % 2 == 0:
        return 1 # belongs to the PARITY language
    else:
        return 0 # does not belong to the PARITY language
```

Please note that these are simplified code snippets for illustrative purposes and do not cover all aspects of the described models or functions in the paper. The actual implementation of these models and guide functions would be significantly more complex and would likely require additional libraries and tools beyond those used here.
