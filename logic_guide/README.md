Title: Research Paper Implementation: Leveraging Guides for Certified Reasoning in Language Models

Introduction:
This research paper focuses on implementing a framework that allows language models (LMs) to rely on trusted formal deductions during generation by utilizing external tools called guides. The guides enable a declarative interaction between the tool and the model, facilitating logical reasoning and producing reliable natural language rationales. The authors introduce the LOGICGUIDE as a guide tool for LMs to perform externally certified reasoning using the Peano theorem-proving environment.

Architecture:
1. Guide Functions: The guide function, g, defines a set of valid generations given previous choices. It takes a sequence of previously generated strings and returns a regular set of allowed next generations.
2. Guide Tools as Completion Engines: The guide tool is implemented as a completion engine using the Constrained Semantic Decoding (CSD) algorithm. The completion engine, c, dynamically computes a set of valid continuations, constraining the LM's output between special delimiters.
3. The LOGICGUIDE: LOGICGUIDE is a guide tool that leverages the Peano theorem-proving environment. It allows LMs to perform externally certified reasoning by formalizing assumptions, setting proof goals, and making sound inference steps.

Algorithmic Pseudocode:
1. Guide Functions:
```
function guideFunction(generatedSequence):
    return set of valid next generations based on generatedSequence
```

2. Guide Tools as Completion Engines:
```
function completionEngine(inputString):
    if inputString ends with t1:
        Sp = extract blocks of text between t1 and t2 in inputString
        return regular expression matching strings in guideFunction(Sp) ending with t2
    else:
        return regular expression matching any string not containing t1 and ending in t1
```

Mathematical Algorithmic Proof:
The implementation of guide functions and completion engines ensures that the LM generates sequences within the constraints defined by the guides. The CSD algorithm guarantees a valid sample by construction, leveraging the completion engine to determine valid continuations at each step of generation.

Other Important Information:
The research paper discusses the compatibility of the framework with different LM architectures, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and LLaMA. It also highlights the effectiveness of the LOGICGUIDE in improving reasoning accuracy and reducing content effects in LMs. The paper mentions the use of few-shot prompting and the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) approach for further improvements in reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion:
Implementing the proposed framework enables LMs to perform certified reasoning by incorporating external tools and logical guides. The LOGICGUIDE, based on the Peano theorem-proving environment, allows LMs to generate reliable natural language rationales backed by formal logical inferences. This approach expands the computational power of LMs and provides a promising avenue for combining formal reasoning with the flexibility of language models.
